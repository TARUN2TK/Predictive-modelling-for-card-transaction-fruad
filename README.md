# Predictive-modelling-for-card-transaction-fruad
Predictive modelling for credit card transaction fraud.

Language Used: R programming

Data source: Github

Steps to run the code:
1) Open .Rmd in RStudio
2) It does not require any additional work or changes! Simply run and verify the results. 

Note: There can be a slight variation in performance on each run as I have not fixed the seed or random number generation for each time sampling is used in the code! But this should not affect the results greatly.
